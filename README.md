# Flashfood-App-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

*Sometime in June this year (2021), I came across an article on sentiment analysis on Medium. It was an interesting and insightful article. Also, it was my first time of knowing about the following terms: sentiment analysis, natural language processing (nlp), text analytics. There and then, I decided to do a project on this. As they say, we learn best by doing and this sums up this project. I dived in on this project not knowing what to expect. I researched about nlp (sentiment analysis), learned, applied as I worked on the project. The ipynb file which you see here is result of hours of work and long evenings. But its worth the effort because I learnt so much about nlp.*

### About the project:
I scraped the User Reviews for the Flashfood App from the Google play store using Google Play Scraper. Then, I did a sentiment analysis of the reviews and made recommendations based on the insights drawn from the analysis.
